## Work History

**Developer: April 2010 - Present Day**  
At Wirebox I have worked on a large range of projects both in-house and on site at our clients offices. These projects would usually have different teams assigned to them which meant switching between working solo and in teams of up to ten developers. It was common practice for us to juggle feature requests by using GIT branching strategies to create and release new spec requirements.

**[Mewe](http://www.mewemusic.com)**  
Mewe music is a social media platform for musicians that we are currently developing at Wirebox. This involved creating a large API with many data resources which supported a angular and IOS app. The application boasts a message and notification system which lead us to work with the NoSql database MongoDB to ensure quick API responses with large datasets. Stripe payment gateway was also integrated into the apps and API to monetize the project.
  
**[SyQic](http://syqic.com/)**  
For the last two years I have been working on-site with our client SyQic, creating RESTful API’s and single page applications to deliver their multi lingual video content. Their video platforms targeted the global mobile market, which meant all layouts had to be responsive and function on a variety of mobile handsets. We used AngularJS to give site a “native app” feel and Amazon’s CloudFront service to speed up global distribution. One of the applications stand out features was its freemium model, which was a mixture of advertising using Google’s DFP and SMS billing which required us to integrate with different payment gateways and telecommunication companies. The development team working on the project was quite large so we used Vagrant and Ansible to standardised developers environments which improved code reliability and increased development speed.

**Developer: January 2009 - April 2010**  
I started my career as an PHP/HTML developer small dynamic websites and web forms. Many of the sites required SEO tweaks, Google Analytics and Adsense integrations.  

**[Woodovis Park](http://www.woodovis.com/)**  
The Devonshire campsite commissioned us to create a large touchscreen information board that would inform their guests of activities and events in the local area. Taking into account the unique hardware and environment we worked closely with our clients, wireframing and testing the UI to create a great user experience.  

##Hobbies and Interests 
In my spare time I enjoy playing bass guitar.
