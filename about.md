While studding Electrical Installation at college, a friend employed me part-time to create websites. During this time I caught the programming bug and over the last 6 years I have never looked back.

In that time I have become familiar working in a LAMP environment. Creating small static sites to large web applications. Using PHP, MySQL and JavaScript to help create online solutions for my company's clients.

I enjoy continuously furthering my skills in all aspects of development and take a huge amount of pride in crafting quality code and creating great solutions.  

##Skills Summary
* PHP, PHPUnit, Laravel, Composer
