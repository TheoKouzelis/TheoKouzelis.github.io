## Open Source Contributions  
**[Laravel Airbrake](https://github.com/TheoKouzelis/laravel-airbrake)**  
A package authored by myself which bootstraps the official Airbrake package to the Laravel framework. It also solves a 
security issue by filtering sensitive variables from the log messages which are set by the framework.  

**[My Dev Environment](https://github.com/TheoKouzelis/my-dev-env)**  
Bash scripts to build my developer environment on remote servers and virtual machines.

**[Laravel Framework](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/17151)**  
Helped fix an issue in one of the frameworks consolei commands.

**[PHP Workshop](https://github.com/php-school/php-workshop/pull/126)**  
Helped to increase unit test coverage for the package as part of their "hacktoberfest" drive.

**[Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/pull/422)**  
Improved the exception errors within the Monolog StreamHandler after experiencing a confusing error within my own application.

**[Quarx](https://github.com/YABhq/Quarx/pull/18)**  
Upgraded the packages dependancy on laravel-analytics to the latest release. This made the packages installation easier.

## Work History
[![Wirebox Logo](/images/wirebox-logo.jpg)](http://www.wirebox.co.uk/)

**Developer: April 2010 - Present Day**  
At Wirebox I work on a large range of projects, both remotely and on site at our client's offices. I play a large roll in quoting 
on new work and liaising with clients to spec out software features. It's common for us to work alone or in teams where we have to 
juggle multiple features by using GIT branching strategies. Within the company I help mentoring some of the junior developers and 
research new technologies.  

**[NQ Solicitors](https://nqsolicitors.com/)**  
NQ Solicitors is a website created for our client to help match newly qualified solicitors to potential employers.  

We used the Laravel framework to create this bespoke application. The team was comprised of myself and three other developers. To help 
standardise our environments we used the frameworks Vagrant based package Homestead. To further ease development for some of the team I 
created bash scripts which expanded on the base Homestead image. These scripts installed mailcatcher, ran package managers Composer and 
NPM, compiled Javascript and CSS files with Elixir/Gulp, ran database migrations/seeders and helped them to switch between GIT branches. 

I was the main point of contact with the client for the team. I organised the team by relaying new feature requests and bug reports using 
the DoneDone ticket manager. We provisioned both a staging and production server using Laravel Forge. The push to deploy feature enabled us 
to demo new features by merging code to a staging branch. Which when approved, would then be released to production by merging to the master 
branch.

To help us monitor the application in the wild we have added logging to all areas of the application and receive real time error reports 
using Airbrake.  

The application was officially launched on the 26th of October 2016.

**Developer: January 2009 - April 2010**  
I started my career as an PHP/HTML developer creating small dynamic websites and web forms. Many of the sites required SEO tweaks, 
Google Analytics and Adsense integrations.  

**[Woodovis Park](http://www.woodovis.com/)**  
The award winning Devonshire campsite commissioned us to create a large touchscreen information board that would inform their guests of 
activities and events in the local area. Taking into account the unique hardware and environment we worked closely with our 
clients, wireframing and testing the UI to create a great user experience.  

## Hobbies and Interests 
In my spare time I enjoy listening to development podcasts, watching science documentaries and playing ukulele and bass guitar.
