## Open Source Contributions  
### [Laravel Airbrake](https://github.com/TheoKouzelis/laravel-airbrake)
A package authored by myself which bootstraps the official Airbrake package to the Laravel framework. It also solves a 
security issue by filtering sensitive variables from the log messages which are set by the framework.  

### [PHP Workshop](https://github.com/php-school/php-workshop/pull/126)
Helped to increase unit test coverage for the package as part of their "hacktoberfest" drive.

### [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog/pull/422)
Improved the exception errors within the Monolog StreamHandler after experiencing a confusing error within my own application.

### [Quarx](https://github.com/YABhq/Quarx/pull/18)
Upgraded the packages dependancy on laravel-analytics to the latest release. This made the packages installation easier.

### [Text Truncator](https://github.com/TheoKouzelis/text-truncator)
A package authored by myself to limit paragraphs of text and append "read more" links or ellipses.  


## Work History
[![Wirebox Logo](/images/wirebox-logo.jpg)](http://www.wirebox.co.uk/)

**Developer: April 2010 - Present Day**  
At Wirebox I work on a large range of projects, both remotely and on site at our clients offices. I play a large roll in quoting on new work and liaising with clients to spec out software features. Its common for us to work solo or in large teams, were we have to juggle multiple features by using GIT branching strategies.

**[Mewe](http://www.mewemusic.com)**  
Mewe music is a social media platform for musicians that we are currently developing at Wirebox. This involved creating a large API with many data resources which supported a angular and IOS app. The application boasts a message and notification system which lead us to work with the NoSql database MongoDB to ensure quick API responses with large datasets. Stripe payment gateway was also integrated into the apps and API to monetize the project.
  
**[SyQic](http://syqic.com/)**  
For the last two years I have been working on-site with our client SyQic, creating RESTful API’s and single page applications to deliver their multi lingual video content. Their video platforms targeted the global mobile market, which meant all layouts had to be responsive and function on a variety of mobile handsets. We used AngularJS to give site a “native app” feel and Amazon’s CloudFront service to speed up global distribution. One of the applications stand out features was its freemium model, which was a mixture of advertising using Google’s DFP and SMS billing which required us to integrate with different payment gateways and telecommunication companies. The development team working on the project was quite large so we used Vagrant and Ansible to standardised developers environments which improved code reliability and increased development speed.

**Developer: January 2009 - April 2010**  
I started my career as an PHP/HTML developer small dynamic websites and web forms. Many of the sites required SEO tweaks, Google Analytics and Adsense integrations.  

**[Woodovis Park](http://www.woodovis.com/)**  
The Devonshire campsite commissioned us to create a large touchscreen information board that would inform their guests of activities and events in the local area. Taking into account the unique hardware and environment we worked closely with our clients, wireframing and testing the UI to create a great user experience.  

## Hobbies and Interests 
In my spare time I enjoy playing bass guitar.
