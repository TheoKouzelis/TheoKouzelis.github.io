While studding at college to become an electrician, I was employed by a friend to help create websites. During this time I 
caught the programming bug and over the last 6 years I have never looked back.

In that time I have become very familiar working with a LAMP environment, creating small static sites to large web 
applications. While my main skills are interpreting business logic into PHP and MySQL code, I also have experience creating 
front end applications with JavaScript libraries such as AngularJS and jQuery, and CSS frameworks like Bootstrap. In this 
last year I have also had the chance to learn aspects of the Dev Ops side of the business, provisioning virtual servers using 
Vagrant and Ansible and re-creating them on AWS instances.
