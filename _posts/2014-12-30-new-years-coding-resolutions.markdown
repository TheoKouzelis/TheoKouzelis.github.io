Its that time of year again when we take stock of the the years triumphs and failures. And along with my attempts to convince my self I enjoy running, I can see some of my programming goals have gone a little wayward as well.

This is due to the classic problem of taking on to many goals at once. It’s especially easy with programming because there are endless subject pools to dip your toes into. 

This year I started to learn Testing/TDD. But then decided to combine this with learning Python, while also switching my editor to Vim. Darting from one subject to the next has stopped me completing any one goal.

So my new years coding resolution is to do less and focus on just two subjects, Vim and Testing. I would like to set myself a small goal in each subject every month. January’s goals are:

* Stop using the arrow keys in Vim. 

* Read [The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications](https://leanpub.com/grumpy-testing)

Happy New Year.
