Its that time of year again when we take stock of the the years triumphs and failures. And just like my attempts to loose my falafel gut,
I can see some of my programming goals have gone a little wayward as well. 

This is mainly due to the classic problem of taking on to many goals at once. It's especially easy with programming because there are 
endless subject pools to dip your toes into. This year I started to practice Testing/TDD, but decided to combine this with learning 
Python, while switching my editor to Vim. I would try to create side projects or contribute to open source using tools or frameworks 
I have never used before and get bogged down reading documentation. Then I would try to read as many books as I could 
simultaneously, keep up with blog posts, podcasts, videocasts and any other learning resource. Darting from one subject to the 
next has stopped me fully completing any one goal.

So my new years coding resolution is to focus on two subjects only, Vim and Testing. I would like to set myself a small goal in each 
subject every month. Januaryâ€™s goals are:

* Stop using the arrow keys in Vim. 

* Read [The Grumpy Programmer's Guide To Building Testable PHP Applications](https://leanpub.com/grumpy-testing)

Happy New Year.
